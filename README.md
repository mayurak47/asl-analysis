# ASL Analysis

This repository contains code for my final project as part of the Global Academic Internship Program, Summer 2019 at the National University of Singapore.

The objective of the project is to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into the characters they represent, and perform sentiment analysis on the words formed thus.

In `Project_Final.ipynb`, the performance of various machine learning and deep learning models is compared.  
In `Kaggle_Sentiment_Analysis`, a model is trained to classify the sentiment of a given sentence.  
`cv.py` is a utility to capturing images from a webcam using OpenCV.
